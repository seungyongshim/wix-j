1.1 The Software Package

> before you ship anything

A dead link.

1.2 The Files Inside

> Windows Installer with use this description to prompt for it

"will" instead of "with"

1.7 Beyond Files

It's not up to date. Registry element is deprecated in WiX 3.

2.3 UI Wizardry

> WixUI has four different flavors

"five" instead of "four".
		
2.6 "SampleWixUIAddDlgLoc" source code

It compiles good, but will produce errors during the
installation when you click on the "back" and "next" buttons
in the UserRegistrationDlg.
The following two lines should be added.

<Property Id="WixUI_UserRegistrationDlgBack">LicenseAgreementDlg</Property>
<Property Id="WixUI_UserRegistrationDlgNext">SetupTypeDlg</Property>

4 Upgrades and Modularization

The general descriptions of the three methods of updating
or upgrading of the product could be revised in order to
inform the readers explicitly that Major Upgrade would
probably be the best solution for almost all circumstances
when the product is not very large.

Some description of .wixlibs would be appreciated, though
it might not be a major concern.

4.1 Checking for Oldies

The "safety lock" will not work for Small Updates and
Minor Upgrades. Because the product guid of the newer
package is the same as the old one, it has to be opened
with the command line switches of "REINSTALL=ALL 
REINSTALLMODE=vomus", and it will force the installer
to run in the maintenance mode where FindRelatedProducts
custom action will return instantly without searching the
related products. Consequently, neither "SELFFOUND" nor
"NEWERFOUND" will be filled as expected.

4.1 "SampleUpgrade" source coude

The version of "New" remains 1.0.0, but it should be 1.0.1.

4.2 Replacing Ourselves

RemoveExistingProducts custom action should be mentioned.
The scheduling of it is needed for Major Upgrade.

5.3 Web Directory

It's not up to date.
WiX 3 has its IIS extention in WixIISExtension.dll,
not in sca.wixlib. And Web- elements have been moved
to a separated namespace.
		
6.2 Expression Syntax

> advertised (only for components)

It should be "advertised (only for features)".

8.4 Customizations Galore

> Setting Indirect tells the installer to actually modify
> the property value with the path the user selects

This is a little bit misleading. What tells the installer
to modify the property value is not Indirect attribute but
is Property attribute. What Indirect="yes" tells the installer
is that the target is not "_BrowseProperty" property itself, 
but some other property of which "_BrowseProperty" holds the
name.

10.1 Custom Actions and User Interface

> Indirect="yes"

It should be Indirect="no", otherwise the list box will not
come up with the items that the CA has filled.
